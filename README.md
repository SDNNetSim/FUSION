# Flexible Unified System for Intelligent Optical Networking (FUSION)

## About This Project

Welcome to **FUSION**, an open-source venture into the future of networking! Our core focus is on simulating **Software Defined Elastic Optical Networks (SD-EONs)**, a cutting-edge approach that promises to revolutionize how data is transmitted over optical fibers. But that's just the beginning. We envision FUSION as a versatile simulation framework that can evolve to simulate a wide array of networking paradigms, now including the integration of **artificial intelligence** to enhance network optimization, performance, and decision-making processes.

We need your insight and creativity! The true strength of open-source lies in community collaboration. Join us in pioneering the networks of tomorrow by contributing your unique simulations and features. Your expertise in AI and networking can help shape the future of this field.

## Installation Instructions

FUSION offers multiple installation methods. Choose the one that best fits your needs:

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

For the easiest setup experience, use our automated installation script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:SDNNetSim/FUSION.git
cd FUSION

# Create and activate a Python 3.11 virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Run automated installation
./install.sh
```

The script automatically:
- Detects your platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Handles PyTorch Geometric compilation issues
- Installs all dependencies in the correct order
- Sets up development tools
- Installs and configures pre-commit hooks
- Verifies the installation

### Package Installation

For a more controlled installation using Python packaging:

```bash
# Clone and create venv (same as above)
git clone git@github.com:SDNNetSim/FUSION.git
cd FUSION
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install core package
pip install -e .

# Install optional components as needed:
pip install -e .[dev]        # Development tools (ruff, mypy, pytest, pre-commit)
pip install -e .[rl]         # Reinforcement learning (stable-baselines3)
pip install -e .[all]        # Everything except PyTorch Geometric

# Install pre-commit hooks (for development)
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg

# PyTorch Geometric requires manual installation:
# macOS (Apple Silicon):
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 pip install --no-build-isolation torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.2.2+cpu.html

# macOS (Intel):
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15 pip install --no-build-isolation torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.2.2+cpu.html

# Linux/Windows:
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.2.2+cpu.html

# Finally install PyTorch Geometric:
pip install torch-geometric==2.6.1
```

### Legacy Requirements Installation

If you prefer using requirements files:

```bash
# Core dependencies
pip install torch==2.2.2
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**Note**: This method may fail on PyTorch Geometric packages. Use the automatic installer instead.

## Standards and Guidelines

To maintain the quality and consistency of the codebase, we adhere to the following standards and guidelines:

1. **Commit Formatting**: Follow the commit format specified [here](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53).
2. **Code Style**: All code should follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) coding style guidelines.
3. **Versioning**: Use the [semantic versioning system](https://semver.org/) for all git tags.
4. **Coding Guidelines**: Adhere to the team's [coding guidelines document](CODING_STANDARDS.md).
5. **Unit Testing**: Each unit test should follow the [FUSION testing standards](TESTING_STANDARDS.md).

## Development & Contributing

### Setting Up Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks for code quality checks. Set them up once:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hooks
pre-commit install

# Install commit message hook
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

### Running Code Quality Checks

**Pre-commit hooks (recommended):**
```bash
# Run all checks on staged files
pre-commit run

# Run all checks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific hook
pre-commit run ruff --all-files
pre-commit run mypy --all-files
```

**Using Makefile:**
```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Run linting (using pre-commit)
make lint

# Full validation (lint + tests)
make validate

# Clean up generated files
make clean
```

### What Gets Validated

Pre-commit hooks check:
- **Ruff** - Code linting and formatting (replaces pylint)
- **Mypy** - Type checking
- **Vulture** - Dead code detection
- **Bandit** - Security vulnerability scanning
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Trailing whitespace, file endings, YAML validation
- **Conventional commits** - Commit message format

### Development Workflow

1. Install pre-commit hooks (one time): `pre-commit install`
2. Make your changes
3. Stage files: `git add .`
4. Hooks run automatically on commit, or run manually: `pre-commit run`
5. Run tests: `make test` or `pytest`
6. Submit your PR - all checks should pass
