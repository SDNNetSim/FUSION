## Generated By

- **analysis/**: `scripts/analyze_dependencies.sh`
- **diagrams/**: `scripts/generate_diagrams.sh`
- **profiling/**: `scripts/profile_performance.sh`
- **coverage/**: `make test-new` or `pytest --cov`

## Usage

### Generate Reports
```bash
# All code quality checks (includes analysis)
make check-all

# Individual components
make analyze          # Generate analysis reports
make profile          # Generate profiling reports
scripts/generate_diagrams.sh  # Generate architecture diagrams

# Test coverage
make test-new         # Generates coverage reports
```

### View Results
```bash
# View coverage report in browser
open reports/coverage/htmlcov/index.html

# View performance profile interactively
snakeviz reports/profiling/profile.prof

# View dependency graphs
open reports/diagrams/architecture_overview.png
```

## Directory vs. Other Project Directories

- **`data/`**: Simulation input/output data and network topologies
- **`docs/`**: Sphinx documentation source files (RST format)
- **`reports/`**: Development tool outputs and code quality reports (this directory)
- **`scripts/`**: Development workflow automation scripts
- **`tools/`**: Project validation and CI/CD scripts

## CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/quality.yml` automatically generates and uploads these reports as artifacts for every PR and push.

## Cleanup

Generated reports can be safely deleted and regenerated:
```bash
# Clean all reports
rm -rf reports/analysis/* reports/diagrams/* reports/profiling/* reports/coverage/*

# Or use make clean target (if implemented)
make clean
```
