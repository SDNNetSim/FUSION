# GUI Module - DEPRECATED

⚠️ **This module is currently deprecated and not supported.**

## Status

The `fusion/gui` module is no longer maintained and has been excluded from all quality checks and pre-commit hooks. This module requires a complete revamp before it can be used in production.

## Reason for Deprecation

The GUI implementation needs to be redesigned and updated to:
- Align with current project architecture
- Meet modern code quality standards
- Support the latest FUSION framework features
- Follow established design patterns used in other modules

## Exclusions

This module is excluded from:
- **Ruff** - Code linting and formatting
- **Mypy** - Type checking
- **Vulture** - Dead code detection
- **Bandit** - Security checks

## Future Plans

This module will be revamped in a future release. If you need GUI functionality, please consider:
1. Using the command-line interface (CLI) tools available in the project
2. Using the visualization module (`fusion/visualization`) for plotting and analysis
3. Building custom scripts using the FUSION API

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to the GUI revamp, please open an issue on the project repository to discuss the design and implementation approach before starting work.
