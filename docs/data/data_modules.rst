Data Scripts
============

The data scripts provided in this documentation pertain to the structuring of network topology data in Python, along
with the inclusion of detailed topology information. These scripts are essential for preparing network topology data for
simulation and analysis purposes. They enable users to organize network elements, connections, and attributes in a
structured format that is conducive to efficient processing and analysis.

In addition to topology details, these data scripts also provide information on maximum reach and the number of slots
needed for modulation formats used in network simulations. This information is crucial for accurately modeling and
simulating optical communication systems, allowing users to assess network performance and optimize resource allocation
effectively.

Whether you are setting up network simulations, analyzing network performance, or conducting research in optical
communication systems, these data scripts serve as valuable tools for managing and structuring network data efficiently.
