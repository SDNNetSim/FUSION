Unit Tests
===========

Our unit tests pipeline forms the cornerstone of quality assurance for our simulator.  This pipeline executes a
comprehensive suite of tests designed to independently verify the behavior of individual code components.
By rigorously testing at the unit level, we ensure that each part of our simulator functions correctly in isolation,
building a solid foundation for the project as a whole.

Running Unit Tests with Pytest
------------------------------

We utilize the Pytest framework to execute our unit tests. You may simply run them by running ``pytest`` at the top
level of the simulator.
