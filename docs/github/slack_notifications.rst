Slack Notifications
=====================

Our Slack notification pipeline serves as a vital communication link within the development team. It instantly alerts
us to critical events within our project, such as new issues, merge requests, and pipeline failures.
This real-time awareness empowers us to quickly address potential problems and collaborate effectively on code changes.

Why We Use Slack Notifications
-------------------------------

* **Rapid Response:** Slack notifications ensure we're immediately informed of potential issues, allowing for fast troubleshooting and minimizing the impact on our development workflow.
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** Prompt merge request notifications foster swift code reviews and timely integration, streamlining the development process.
* **Proactive Monitoring:** Pipeline failure alerts enable the team to address problems early, maintaining the health and reliability of our simulator.

Private Slack Channel
----------------------

Our development team leverages a private Slack channel for these critical notifications. This ensures that:

* **Focused Communication:**  Project-specific alerts remain clearly visible and relevant within the designated channel, minimizing distractions from other conversations happening in the broader Slack workspace.
* **University Scope:** The private channel is tailored to our university lab's activities, maintaining the focus and accessibility of discussions for those directly involved in the simulator's development.

Due to the reasons mentioned above, this pipeline should always pass for the general user.
