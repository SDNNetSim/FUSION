GitHub Pipelines
=================

To guarantee the robustness and stability of our simulator, we employ a comprehensive suite of GitHub pipelines.
These pipelines meticulously execute tasks ranging from code validation to production updates. This rigorous approach
fosters a collaborative development environment where code changes are thoroughly vetted and delivered confidently.
