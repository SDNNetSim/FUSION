Configuration Scripts
=====================

Introduction
-------------

These configuration scripts are designed to streamline the setup and execution of tasks by seamlessly integrating
command line input and configuration file options. Leveraging a combination of command line arguments and configuration
files, users can easily tailor the behavior of their scripts to suit specific requirements. **Notably,
when a command is provided via the command line, it takes precedence over the corresponding parameter
specified in the configuration file.** This dynamic approach ensures flexibility and adaptability,
allowing users to efficiently manage their workflows with minimal effort.
