Getting Started Tutorial
========================

This tutorial walks you through using Claude Code to explore and understand FUSION.

Step 1: Understand the Project Structure
----------------------------------------

Start by getting an overview of how FUSION is organized:

::

   > What are the main modules in FUSION and what does each one do?

Claude will explain the directory structure and the purpose of each major component.

Step 2: Learn a Core Concept
----------------------------

FUSION deals with optical networking concepts that may be unfamiliar. Ask Claude to explain:

::

   > Explain what RSA (Routing and Spectrum Assignment) means and how FUSION implements it.

::

   > What is spectrum fragmentation and why does it matter?

Step 3: Find Specific Code
--------------------------

When you need to locate specific functionality:

::

   > Where is the main simulation loop? Show me the key functions.

::

   > Which file handles network topology loading?

Step 4: Understand How to Run a Simulation
------------------------------------------

Learn the practical aspects of using the simulator:

::

   > How do I run a basic simulation with FUSION? Walk me through the steps.

::

   > What configuration options are available and where do I set them?

Step 5: Make a Change
---------------------

When you're ready to contribute or modify the code:

::

   > I want to add a new routing algorithm. What files do I need to modify and what interfaces should I implement?

::

   > Show me an example of an existing routing algorithm so I can follow the same pattern.

Step 6: Debug an Issue
----------------------

If you encounter problems:

::

   > The simulation is giving high blocking probability. What should I check?

::

   > I'm getting an error in the spectrum assignment module. Help me understand this traceback.
