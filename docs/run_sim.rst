Run Simulation
===============

The "Run Simulation" script provides functionality to execute simulations without employing artificial intelligence
algorithms. This script serves as a foundational tool for conducting basic network simulations,
allowing users to evaluate network behaviors and performance under various conditions without the complexity of
AI-driven decision-making processes.
