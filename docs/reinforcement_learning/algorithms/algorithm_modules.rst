Algorithms
==============

Here we get into the nuts and bolts of learning itself. This module defines the algorithms
that drive decision-making — from classic Q-learning to policy gradient methods like A2C and PPO.
We also include bandit strategies and lightweight wrappers around SB3 models.
If ``agent_modules`` defines the *who*, this module defines the *how*.
It’s where learning strategies are configured, initialized, and executed.
