Arguments
==============

Our argument modules define the vocabulary of the system. They enumerate the valid algorithm
identifiers, observation space types, and agent registries used across the simulator.
These arguments ensure that the simulator understands what each configuration keyword means
and maps them to the correct logic. In short, this is the shared language between
user configurations and internal modules.
