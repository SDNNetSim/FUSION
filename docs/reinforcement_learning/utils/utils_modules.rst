Utilities
==============
The utilities module consists of helper components, callbacks, wrappers, and setup scripts â€” each playing a supporting role
to simplify or streamline key processes during training and evaluation.

When building environments, caching embeddings, tracking fragmentation, or configuring learning rates,
these files offload the logic so that core files stays clean and modular.
