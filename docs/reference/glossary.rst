   Blocking Probability
      Percentage of connection requests that cannot be established due to insufficient network resources.

   C-Band
      Conventional band (1530-1565 nm), primary wavelength range for optical communications.

   CDC ROADM
      Colorless, Directionless, Contentionless Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer.

   Crosstalk
      Unwanted signal interference between adjacent cores in multicore fibers.

   DQN
      Deep Q-Network, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm.

   Elastic Optical Network (EON)
      Optical network using flex-grid spectrum allocation for efficient bandwidth utilization.

   Erlang
      Unit of traffic intensity (average arrival rate × holding time).

   First-Fit
      Spectrum assignment algorithm that selects the first available spectrum block.

   Flex-Grid
      Flexible frequency grid allowing variable-width spectrum allocation.

   Frequency Slot
      Minimum spectrum allocation unit (typically 12.5 GHz).

   Holding Time
      Duration a connection occupies network resources.

   k-Shortest Paths
      Routing algorithm finding k alternative paths between nodes.

   Modulation Format
      Signal encoding scheme (QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, etc.).

   ROADM
      Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer.

   RSA
      Routing and Spectrum Assignment problem.

   RMCSA
      Routing, Modulation, Core, and Spectrum Assignment problem (multicore networks).

   SDM
      Space-Division Multiplexing using multicore or multi-mode fibers.

   SD-EON
      Software-Defined Elastic Optical Network.

   SNR
      Signal-to-Noise Ratio.

   Spectrum Fragmentation
      Non-contiguous free spectrum blocks reducing allocation efficiency.

   WDM
      Wavelength Division Multiplexing with fixed-grid channels.
