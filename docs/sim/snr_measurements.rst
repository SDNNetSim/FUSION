SNR Measurements
================

The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Functions form a critical component within the simulation environment, responsible for
quantifying the quality of signal transmission relative to background noise. By providing insights into signal clarity
and reliability, these functions enable users to assess and optimize communication performance, crucial for accurate
simulation outcomes and informed decision-making in network design and optimization.
