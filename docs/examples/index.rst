Getting Started
===============

New to FUSION? Start with these examples:

:doc:`basic_simulation`
   **Start here!** Run your first simulation in minutes. Learn the fundamentals of
   configuration, execution, and result analysis.

:doc:`custom_topology`
   Create custom network topologies using JSON, NetworkX, or Python. Examples include
   metro networks, hierarchical topologies, and common patterns (ring, mesh, star).

Advanced Topics
===============

Ready to explore more? Try these advanced examples:

:doc:`ml_decision_tree`
   Use machine learning (scikit-learn decision trees) to optimize routing and
   spectrum assignment based on historical data.

:doc:`rl_training`
   Train deep reinforcement learning agents (DQN, PPO, A2C) using Stable-Baselines3
   for intelligent network resource allocation.

:doc:`advanced_visualization`
   Create publication-quality plots and custom visualizations with matplotlib.
   Compare multiple algorithms and generate professional figures.

:doc:`batch_simulations`
   Run multiple simulations in parallel for parameter sweeps, algorithm comparisons,
   and large-scale experiments.

:doc:`performance_optimization`
   Speed up simulations with parallel execution, memory optimization, and efficient
   configuration strategies.
