Artificial Intelligence
=======================

What is Artifical Intelligence? What types are used in the Simulator?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
words will go here

Machine Learning (ML)
---------------------
Our simulator can run with supervised machine learning. An example of an algorithm used is the decision tree classifier,
which aids in routing and spectrum assignment. It allows for data optimization by diving the space in order to find the
highest information gain. This allows for multiple different routing strategies to be tried.

Reinforcement Learning (RL)
---------------------------
Our simulator has many different uses of reinforcement learning algorithms. The algorithms that have been used at length
are Q-learning, epsilon-greedy bandit, and Upper Confidence Bound (USB). Similarly to machine learning, they have uses
in both routing and spectrum assignment.
