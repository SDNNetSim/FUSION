Getting Started
===============

The SDN Simulator operates primarily off of
configuration (.ini) files, all of which can be customized
and catered to fit individual test needs.



In order to beginning simulating a configuration file, first verify:

    - First, the configuration file must be saved as "Config.ini"

    - Second, the 'Config.ini' file must be saved within 'SDN_Simulatr/Config/run_ini'

Once those two conditions are met, assuming that valid data (per the Configuration Assets page) has been
configured, the simulation will be able to execute.

In order to execute the simulation, the tester must run 'run_sim'.

Note: If the tester attempts to execute 'run_sim' without a 'Config.ini' file saved to the 'run_ini' directory,
they will be reminded to do so. The simulation will be unable to run until that is ammended.
