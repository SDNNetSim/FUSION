# Contributing to the Simulator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the simulator! We value your contributions and want to make the process as smooth as possible for everyone involved. This document outlines how you can contribute, our coding guidelines, the pull request process, and our code of conduct.

## Introduction

This simulator is an open-source initiative, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated. Before contributing, please take a moment to read through this document to understand our processes and guidelines.

## How to Contribute

1. **Report Issues**: If you find a bug or have a suggestion for an improvement, please report it using the project's issue tracker. Be sure to search for existing issues before creating a new one.

2. **Submit Pull Requests**: If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, please submit a pull request (PR). Ensure your PR has a clear title and description, and follows our coding guidelines and PR process outlined below.

3. **Review Contributions**: You can also contribute by reviewing pull requests submitted by others. Providing feedback and suggestions can greatly improve the quality of contributions.

## Coding Guidelines

### 1. Naming Conventions

1. **Helper Scripts**: Files in the `helper_scripts` directory should be named using the
   pattern `<script_name>_helpers.py`.
2. **Data Structures**: Name variables with their type, e.g., `<name>_list`, `<name>_dict`, `<name>_set`.
3. **Class Properties**: Include a dictionary named `<ClassName>_props` in class constructors for properties.
4. **Inner Classes**: Name classes within a constructor `<ClassName>_Obj` to indicate scope and relationship.

### 2. Directory and File Structure

1. **Argument Scripts**: Place external files with arguments in the `arg_scripts` directory,
   named `<file_name>_args.py`.
2. **Module Naming**: Directories with Python scripts should follow `<name>_scripts` naming convention.

### 3. Coding Practices

1. **Function Names**: Use assertive and descriptive names like `get`, `create`, `update`.
2. **Type Annotations**: Explicitly list variable types in all function parameters.
3. **Commenting and Documentation**:
    - Use `# FIXME:` for areas needing future fixes, with a brief explanation if necessary.
    - Use `# TODO:` for planned enhancements or tasks, with a concise description.
4. **Argument Labeling**: Label arguments explicitly when calling functions.

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test every function and its branches thoroughly.
2. **Formatting**: Use an auto-formatting tool to maintain consistent code formatting, adhering to a style guide like
   PEP 8.

### 5. Additional Considerations

1. **Class and File Naming Alignment**: Ensure class names match their `.py` file names.
2. **Argument Documentation**: Comment each argument in argument scripts to explain its purpose and expected values.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is semantic.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
